## Description
Ask Father Time is an application for users in need of advice and or connection.  A user will sign up and be taken to the homepage where they will find a list of questions asked by other users.  A user can click on the dashboard button to see a list of only their own questions.  A user can ask Father Time for any sort of advice.  This application is similar in concept to the "Dear Abby" advice column in a newspaper publication. Father Time will respond to user's questions with his sage advice. Only the admin of the application has the ability to answer questions, as the admin view and user view of the site are different.  If a user would like to communicate about problems or opinions with other users, there is a live chatroom for real time communication with other users.  There are multiple rooms, each with a different topic such as family, work, relationships etc.  The chatroom also features a random advice generator.  The user can click the "Get Instant Advice" button and will receive a light hearted piece of advice such as "If you cant do anything about it, there's no point in worrying about it".  Lastly, the application features a resources tab where users are directed to books, podcast, crisis hotlines, support groups, forums, etc. for when a problem is too heavy for even Father Time.
